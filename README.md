In the greedy approach, I tried to take advantage of the fact that it's easy to solve small instances of the TSP with brute force. The idea is to divide the map into various smaller zones, calculate an optimal path between these subdivisions by solving a TSP problem, resulting in multiple smaller TSP problems. This step is repeated recursively until the subdivisions become small enough to be solved. I implemented the idea, but ultimately I obtained worse results than with the greedy approach where you successively choose the closest unvisited node until the path is closed.

In the EA approach, I used the strategy of initializing the population with the solution from the greedy approach (min), performing parent selection uniformly, allowing the possibility of applying a crossover operator chosen from a collection of operators, performing mutation through swapping, and using rank based selection for the offspring. The choice of crossover operator given two parents is based on the success that the operator had in the previous generation. The more successful an operator is, the more likely it is to be chosen. However, regardless of an operator's success, a fixed minimum probability is set for each operator.
